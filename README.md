# Arkanoid
Arkanoid game was implemented in Java. First year oop project.

As you can see in the main dir there is the exact project dir.
"biuoop-1.3.jar" is needed as external library to the project.
Main method is in "ArkanoidGame".

There are 4 levels to the game that are represented with the numbers 1-4, in order of ascending difficulty.
The program runs in two modes:
  No-args: The all 4 levels will be performed sequentially.
  Args: numerical series of levels to be performed.
  
When the game is being played, the button "p" on keyboard can be used for pause, and "space" for continue.

enjoy:)
